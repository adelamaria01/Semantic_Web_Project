# Semantic_Web_Project
This project was developed for a course using PHP.
Through this project, I've successfully learned how to exchange data between the frontend and backend using various servers. 
The frontend operates asynchronously, meaning that the page doesn't reload every time a request is made to the backend.

The servers used include: RDF4J Server and Json Server.

PHP libraries utilized include: Guzzle and EasyRdf.

Key concepts acquired include web scraping, sending/receiving data from/to the backend and frontend, sending data from the backend 
to a server, receiving data from the server to the backend, and incorporating JsonLD data into a frontend script.
